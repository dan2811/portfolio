    <section id="bio">My name is Dan. I began learning the drums at 12 years old. Since then it has turned into a passion/obsession. I studied at Derby Yamaha Music School and achieved a distinction at grade 8 when I was 16. I then began playing in local cover bands around the Derbyshire area whilst studying Music Technology at Derby College. I achieved a triple distinction for my work on this course as well as obtaining a role at Derby Yamaha Music School as a drum teacher. At 18 I went on to study Music Technology and Production at the University of Derby, graduating with a 2:1. Since completing my degree I have performed all over the country with various bands and productions.
        I am now also accredited by the Derby & Derbyshire Music Partnership.</section>
